# Game Ideas
1. Forrest themed, start with companion animal, gain animals as you go through the woods, animals have persistent stats, come across different events which heal or power up you or your creatures.  Mission: Dragon that attacked your town, and the person who defeats the dragon gets the King's daughter in marriage. Obstacles: Other woodland creatures, Dragon.

2. Play as a dragon.  Adventurers travel into your cave seeking to kill you and/or take your treasures.  You have to exit the cave in order to find food to eat.  There is a chance adventurers will either take your treasures or set up an ambush for you when you return.  Start with a lot of health and magic.  However, as time goes on and you fight more heros, your strength decreases.  Mission: Retain as much power as possible for the final fight against the HERO.  Choices: When to leave your home, when to return, what abilities to use.

3. You play as an animal.  Mission: Survive until you find a mate.  Hunger, thirst, shelter from natural disasters.  Predator: gain stats and special abilities defeating different animals, but your hunger increases faster.  Prey: food is abundant, but you have to out maneuver predators.  He Is Coming movement style with gates for certain types of animals, to make it easier for prey to run away.

## Chosen Game: Forrest Dwellers (1)

# Game Description

## Objective
- Slay the Dragon.

## How to reach the objective
- Gather animals along the way (or don't)
- Upgrade stats through events and battles
- Collect items and armor for yourself and your companions

## Mechanics
### Game Loop
- Battle Start
- Battle
- Battle Resolution
- Event #1
- Event #2
- Repeat until final battle
### Battle Start
- For the first battle, encounter a starting animal with 100% chance to ask to join the player on its first turn
- Otherwise, encounter 1-3 enemies
- Player can have up to 3 animal companions
- Turn order starts with the highest speed stat and goes to the lowest speed stat
- Resolve Battle Start effects
### Battle
- The following applies to the player or animal whose turn it is:
- Resolve start of turn effects (stun, etc.)
- If the animal is dead, apply a Stench 1 effect on all allies and skip Attack phase
- If it is the player's turn, choose which animal(s) to attack
- Otherwise, choose which animal(s) to attack based on attack preference
- If it is an enemy, it may offer to join the Player's group on its turn instead of attacking.  This is made more likely based on how low the enemy's health is.
- If no enemies remain or the player dies, go to Battle Resolution
- Resolve end of turn effects (poison, etc.)
### Battle Resolution
- If the player dies, Game Over
- Otherwise, party members gain XP scaled to the number and difficulty of the enemies
- When an animal or player levels up, their stats increase (except MP)
- Some animals drop different items (pelts, teeth, etc.) used for trading with the trader
### Event #1
- Campfire: Heal all but one party members (HP and MP restored, all status effects removed).  May heal last party member, but if you do there is a risk that enemies will ambush you, skipping Event #2.
### Event #2
- Trader: May trade animal loot for items (like in He Is Coming).
- Blue Fairy: Offer to increase a chosen party member's MP.  However, it may be a trick fairy which will also drain your party member's MP to half.
- Red Fairy: Offer to sacrifice an animal to give half its stats to a different party member.  However, it may be a trick fairy which will just give all of one stat to the other party member.
- Green Fairy: Infuse one of your animal's special ability into another party member (yes even the player).  This can stack.  However, it may be a trick fairy, and the party member who received the ability may die.  The odds of the party member dying increase each time that particular party member is infused with another animal's ability.
